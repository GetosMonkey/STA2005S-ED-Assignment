# üå∂Ô∏è Introduction:

The two chilli farmers, Ms Hopeful and Mr Growing, compete head to head for the hearts and minds of the South African chilli market. But despite their names Ms Hopeful seems to always get higher chilli yields than Mr Growing. In Mr Growing's eyes this cannot continue.

### Aim:

This experiment aims to systematically evaluate the effect of light levels, heat levels and chilli variety on crop quality and yield. With our results we will be able to give evidence-based recommendations on optimal growing conditions.

**Particularly we seek to answer:**

1.  Which light and heat settings produce the highest quality chillies?

2.  Does the above depend on variety?

3.  Does quality depend on variety?

4.  How big are the differences?

### Priori Hypothesis:

Prior to collecting the data, we hypothesize:

-   $H_1$: Mean quality will increase with an increase in light levels

-   $H_2$: Mean Quality will increase with intermediate heat levels (2-3), as extreme heat may damage plant cells while insufficient heat limits growth.
  
- $H_3$: There may (or may not) be a Heat $\times$ Light interaction.

-   $H_4$:  Both varieties will show similar response patterns to light and heat treatments. But mean quality will differ by variety.

- $H_5$: Plot side (North/South) will have negligible effect on quality after accounting for other factors.

# üîç Experimental Design and Randomization:

## Simulating data:

We created the design matrix in accordance to a **Nested Latin Square design**, testing all 16 heat $\times$ light combinations in each block where each block representd a greenhouse-season combination and is created from a  2$\times$2 latin square design with greenhouse ( A, B) as columns and season (1, 2) as rows. 

**treatment factors:**

-   Light: 4 levels (1, 2, 3, 4)

-   Heat: 4 levels (1, 2, 3, 4)

$\implies 16$ unique treatments

**blocking factors:**

-   Season: (1, 2)

-   Greenhouse: (A, B)

-   Side of greenhouse: (N = north-facing, S = south-facing)

-   Chilli variety: (R = red-hot, F = furious)

**response variables: ** quality score, which combines taste, yield, and look


![Blocking example greenhouse](Example_setup.png)

**Design:**

Within our design we have an outer $2\times2$ Latin square design, creating a 4 outer blocks separating the 4 possible combinations of the 2 greenhouses (A & B) and the 2 seasons. Each of these represents a separate experimental block.

- Block 1 = Season 1 √ó Greenhouse A\
- Block 2 = Season 1 √ó Greenhouse B\
- Block 3 = Season 2 √ó Greenhouse A\
- Block 4 = Season 2 √ó Greenhouse B

Inside each block, there is an inner $2\times2$ Latin square layer, creating a 4 block grid. The variety (*Redhot* or *Furious*) and side (*North* or *South*) were assigned according to the plan shown below:

| Side  | Variety      | Description |
|-------|--------------|-------------|
| North | Redhot (RN)  | 4 plots     |
| North | Furious (FN) | 4 plots     |
| South | Redhot (RS)  | 4 plots     |
| South | Furious (FS) | 4 plots     |

This gives 8 plots per variety and 8 plots per side in each block ‚Äî ensuring full balance within every greenhouse‚Äìseason combination.

The overarching structure is thus such that: Heat-Light is nested within Side-variety which are is nested Season-greenhouse combinations.

![Blocking factors Diagram](Blocking_factors_pic.png){width=70%}


### Randomization:

Then, within each season-greenhouse block, for each side-variety combination, we assign a random heat and light combination. This means that Inside each block, all **16 combinations** of **Heat (H1‚ÄìH4)** and **Light (L1‚ÄìL4)** were used once, creating a full factorial of the two treatment factors.\
These 16 Heat‚ÄìLight combinations were **randomised independently** within each block to reduce bias.

**Constraints: ** 

Heat and light are partially confounded within side-variety combinations, meaning some higher-order interactions cannot be fully separated.

We are limited to 2 greenhouses, 2 seasons, and 16 plots withni each of the greenhouses, 8 plots per side.

### Simulation: 

The simulated quality data was generated using the **`get.observations()`** function with a fixed random seed (**`set.seed(22)`**) to ensure reproducibility.

The generated design matrix was also validated with a loop which checks for correct randomization and that each heat-light combination is used once per side-variety combination.

### **The Model & Initial Interpretation**

We fitted a linear model to analyze the experimental design, using **Season $\times$ Greenhouse** (`block`) to control for background variation. The model tested the main effects of **heat**, **light**, **variety**, and **side**, as well as all two-way interactions involving the primary treatment factors (`heat:light`, `heat:variety`, `light:variety`).

Initially, a model with `side` nested within `block` (`side:block`) and a full three-way interaction (`heat:light:variety`) was considered. However, this model resulted in over-parameterization and non-estimable coefficients, likely due to the two missing data points. Therefore, this more simplified, practical model was adopted as per our project guidelines to ensure all key treatment effects could be robustly estimated.

Due to two missing observations, the design became unbalanced. Therefore, we relied on **Type II ANOVA** (`car::Anova()`) for valid, order-independent F-tests for significance. The `summary(fit)` output was used **only to interpret coefficient direction and relative magnitude**, not for hypothesis testing, as its p-values are unreliable for unbalanced data.

From the coefficients, the intercept (~40.48) represents the baseline quality. Positive coefficients for **Heat 3** (~+4.75) and **Heat 4** (~+3.73) suggest a positive effect of heat, while the large coefficients for **Light 2‚Äì4** indicate an even stronger positive effect of light intensity. The model fit is excellent, with an adjusted R¬≤ of 0.93 and a residual standard error of ~1.76.

---

### **ANOVA**

The experiment used a **Latin Square design** with **Season $\times$ Greenhouse** (`block`) as blocks. To ensure model stability, a simplified fixed-effects model was fitted. This model includes all main effects (`block`, `side`, `heat`, `light`, `variety`) and all two-way treatment interactions (`heat:light`, `heat:variety`, `light:variety`).

The fitted linear model was:
`obs ~ block + side + heat*light + variety + heat:variety + light:variety`

$$
\begin{aligned}
\text{obs} = & \text{block} + \text{side} + \text{heat} + \text{light} + \text{variety} \\
& + (\text{heat}:\text{light}) + (\text{heat}:\text{variety}) + (\text{light}:\text{variety})
\end{aligned}
$$

```{r}

# Type II ANOVA
anova_results <- Anova(fit, type = 2)
kable(anova_results, caption = "Type II ANOVA Results")

```

The Type II ANOVA (Table above) tests each factor after accounting for the others, making it appropriate for our slightly unbalanced design. The note *‚Äúmodel has aliased coefficients‚Äù* confirms that some higher-order interactions were not estimable due to the two missing plots; however, the sums of squares were correctly computed by model comparison.

Significant effects were found for **Block** (p = 0.0067), **Heat** (p \< 0.001), **Light** (p \< 0.001), and **Variety** (p = 0.0179). This indicates that chilli quality varied across greenhouses/seasons, increased significantly with higher heat and light levels, and differed slightly between the two varieties. The **Side** factor and all interactions were not significant (p \> 0.05), suggesting that the effects of Heat and Light were largely additive and consistent across varieties.

Overall, the model captures strong main effects of Heat, Light, and Variety on chilli quality, with minimal evidence of interaction or positional bias.


### Model Diagnostics:

```{r diagnostics, fig.height=6, fig.width=7, fig.cap="Residual diagnostic plots showing no serious violations of model assumptions. The Q-Q plot indicates approximate normality, and the residuals vs. fitted plot shows no strong patterns suggesting heteroscedasticity."}

# Check residual assumptions -----------------------------------------------

par(mfrow = c(2, 2), mar = c(4, 4, 2, 1))
plot(fit, which = 1, col = col_palette[1])  # Residuals vs Fitted
plot(fit, which = 2, col = col_palette[1])  # Normal Q‚ÄìQ
plot(fit, which = 3, col = col_palette[1])  # Scale‚ÄìLocation
plot(fit, which = 5, col = col_palette[1])  # Residuals vs Leverage
par(mfrow = c(1, 1))

```

The model assumptions were checked using standard residual plots. The Residuals vs Fitted plot shows a random scatter of points around zero, indicating that the assumption of linearity and homoscedasticity (constant variance) is satisfied. There are no visible patterns or funnel shapes.

The Q-Q plot shows that the residuals lie close to the straight line, confirming that the normality assumption is reasonable. The Scale-Location plot also shows roughly constant spread across fitted values, supporting equal variance.

Finally, the residuals vs leverage plot shows that no points have unusually high leverage or cooks distance, indicating that no single observation unduly influenced the fitted model.

Overall, these diagnostic plots confirm that the model fits the data well, and the results from the type 2 anova can be considered reliable and valid for interpretation.

### Interaction plots:

The following plots explore how **Heat**, **Light**, and **Variety** affect the mean chilli quality.\
Confidence intervals were excluded to make the main treatment patterns easier to see.

  )

sumdat <- dat %>%
  group_by(light, heat, variety) %>%
  summarise(
    mean = mean(obs),

  )
```

```{r, , fig.height=5, fig.width=10, fig.cap="Interaction between Heat and Light levels on chilli quality. Lines represent different Light levels."}

  main = "Interaction: Heat √ó Variety"

))

```

```{r , fig.height=5, fig.width=10, fig.cap="Interaction between Heat levels and Variety on chilli quality. Lines show how Redhot and Furious varieties respond differently to temperature."}

# Light √ó Variety interaction plot

with(dat, interaction.plot(

  x.factor = light,

  trace.factor = variety,

  response = obs,

  fun = mean,

  type = "b",

  col = c("orange","orchid"),

  pch = 16:17,

  xlab = "Light Level",

  ylab = "Mean Quality",

  trace.label = "Variety",

  main = "Interaction: Light √ó Variety"

))

```

### Interpretation of Interaction Plots

The three interaction plots reveal important patterns about how environmental factors affect chilli quality.

All four Light levels (1‚Äì4) show increasing chilli quality as Heat rises from 1 to 3, with a slight plateau or dip at Heat 4. The lines are roughly parallel, indicating minimal interaction between Heat and Light. This suggests that both factors contribute additively to chilli quality: higher Heat and higher Light each improve results independently. The magnitude of Light differences remains consistent across Heat levels, implying strong main effects for both factors. A minor curvature near Heat 3‚Äì4 hints that the effect of Heat may taper at very high temperatures. Overall, chilli quality improves with both Heat and Light, and the best performance is achieved around Heat 3‚Äì4 combined with Light 3‚Äì4.

Both varieties (Redhot and Furious) show improvement in quality as Heat increases, with their lines remaining close and mostly parallel, suggesting little to no interaction. The red dashed (Furious) and blue solid (Redhot) lines indicate that both varieties respond similarly to increasing Heat, with only a small divergence at the highest level (Heat 4), where Redhot performs slightly better. This pattern implies that the Heat effect is consistent across varieties, confirming no meaningful Heat √ó Variety interaction. Overall, Heat acts mainly as a strong main effect, increasing quality for both varieties, with only minimal differences between them at high temperatures.

Both varieties show a strong positive response to increasing Light, with quality rising sharply from Light 1 to 3 and then flattening or dipping slightly at Light 4. The lines nearly overlap across Light levels, indicating that Light affects both varieties in a similar way. This close parallelism and similar slope patterns suggest minimal Light √ó Variety interaction. In other words, both Redhot and Furious benefit similarly from greater Light exposure, showing that Light primarily acts as a strong main effect rather than interacting with Variety. Overall, both varieties achieve top quality under Light levels 3‚Äì4.

```

Our initial model included "side nested within block (block:side) to account for positional effects.

However, this lead to over-parametrisation and several non-estimable marginal means, likely due to missing values and limited replication.

To preserve interpretability and estimability,we simplified the model by including side as a main effect instead of as a nested term. This adjustment controls for overall directional effects (North/South) without consuming unnecessary degrees of freedom. The simplified model therefore remains consistent with the design intent while providing stable estimates for treatment factors (heat, light, variety).

### üîé Q1 ‚Äî Which Heat √ó Light is best?

**Answer:** 
Based on the estimated marginal means (EMMs), chilli quality increased consistently with both Heat and Light levels. The top four treatment combinations were Heat 3 √ó Light 4 (mean = 56.26), Heat 3 √ó Light 3 (55.77), Heat 4 √ó Light 4 (55.73), and Heat 4 √ó Light 3 (55.24). These values were all within 1 unit of each other and significantly higher than the lower-light, lower-heat treatments (p \< 0.001 for most pairwise contrasts). Hence, the best chilli quality was achieved under moderate-high heat (level 3‚Äì4) combined with the highest light intensity (level 4). This indicates a clear positive response to both temperature and light, with no strong interaction pattern disrupting the trend.

### üå± Q2 ‚Äî Do best settings depend on Variety?

**Answer:**
The ANOVA output shows that the interactions between variety and the treatment factors‚Äînamely *heat √ó variety*, *light √ó variety*, and *heat √ó light √ó variety*‚Äîwere all non-significant (p = 0.11, 0.66, and 0.59 respectively). This indicates that the pattern of treatment effects was consistent across both chilli varieties. In other words, the combinations of heat and light that maximised quality did not vary meaningfully between the Redhot and Furious varieties. Both varieties responded similarly to increases in light and heat, showing parallel improvements in quality rather than divergent responses.

### üçÖ Q3 ‚Äî Does quality depend on Variety?

**Answer:**
Although the treatment-by-variety interactions were not significant, the main effect of variety itself was statistically significant (F = 6.51, p = 0.017). 

Estimated marginal means show that Redhot chillies (mean = 50.2 ¬± 0.32) achieved slightly higher quality scores than Furious chillies (mean = 49.0 ¬± 0.30). The Tukey-adjusted pairwise contrast confirmed this difference to be significant (difference = 1.16 ¬± 0.44, t = ‚Äì2.65, p = 0.011). 

Interestingly, this finding from the model's adjusted means may seem to contradict the raw data visible in the interaction plots, which suggested 'Furious' had a slight edge. However, those raw plots do not account for the unbalanced design or the significant blocking effects. Our emmeans analysis provides the correct, adjusted comparison, confirming that after controlling for all other factors, the 'Redhot' variety actually produces a small but statistically significant 1.16-unit advantage in quality.

### Question 4: How big are the differences?


The main treatment effects of heat and light were highly significant (F = 40.37 and 172.91, p \< 0.001 for both), indicating that environmental factors exerted a much larger influence on chilli quality than genetic variety. Increasing light levels produced the greatest improvement in mean quality‚Äîroughly a 16-unit rise between the lowest and highest intensities‚Äîwhile raising heat levels contributed an additional 8-unit gain. Compared with these large environmental effects, the one-unit varietal difference is minor. 

The side main effect was not significant (p > 0.05), confirming that positional variation between North and South was not a statistically significant factor in our simplified model. 

Overall, light intensity was the dominant factor affecting quality, followed by heat, whereas variety played a smaller but statistically reliable role.

```{r}

# üåû Future Reccomendations:

**Primary Recommendation**: Based on this experiment, we recommend a **Heat 3 √ó Light 4** setting for maximizing chili quality. Moderate heat and high light leads to best crop quality and yield.

**Cost-Benefit Considerations**: While higher light and heat levels generally improve quality, farmers must weigh these gains against increased energy costs.

**Variety Selection**: ** *Redhot* ‚âà **1.15** points higher than *Furious* (p ‚âà 0.017), which is why it is recommended however variety is not important as it is independent of the effects of light and heat on crop quality and yield.(all HL√óVar interactions non-significant).

**Practical Implementation**: - If energy is a concern, **H4√óL3** (‚âà ‚àí1.1) or **H3√óL3** (‚âà ‚àí1.7; lower proxy) are practical alternatives.

## Study Limitations

1.  **Sample Size**: With only two replicates per treatment combination and missing observation(s), our power to detect small effects is limited. Confidence intervals for some comparisons are wide.

2.  **Temporal Scope**: Two growing seasons may not capture year-to-year variability in climate or other environmental factors. Long-term validation is recommended.

3.  **Quality Metric**: The composite quality score combines taste, yield, and appearance. Economic returns may depend more heavily on one component (e.g., yield). Future studies should examine these components separately.

4.  **Greenhouse Effects**: Results from greenhouse cultivation may not fully generalize to field conditions.

5.  **Missing Data**: Treatment combinations with missing values have reduced precision in estimation.

## Future Directions

-   Replicate the experiment with larger sample sizes to narrow confidence intervals
-   Conduct economic analysis incorporating energy costs and market prices
-   Separate quality into components (taste, yield, appearance) for targeted optimization
-   Test intermediate settings between levels to fine-tune recommendations
-   Evaluate performance under varying weather conditions across multiple years
